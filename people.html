                <p>
                    Drew joined our group as a PhD student with the support of the inaugural Deep Tech Commercialization scholarship. Drew started his career as an undergraduate in the Nanotechnology Engineering program at the University of Waterloo, where he developed a focus on adapting emerging technologies for health and environmental applications. Over the course of his studies, he worked on projects utilizing nanomaterials in the treatment of cancer, and in the reduction of greenhouse gases, culminating in a project aimed at reducing infrastructure damage from ice storms using superhydrophobic coatings. Drew went on to complete a Masters of Engineering in Chemical Engineering, also from the University of Waterloo, while working on a project devoted to using biodegradable polymers to reduce the negative environmental impacts of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture. After graduating, Drew worked for several small technology companies developing health and environmental applications such as Avro Life Science, before starting his own company in 2023.
